Medic!: The first time during each turning point that another friendly operative would be incapacitated while visible
to and within 3" of this operative, you can use this rule, providing neither this nor that operative is within control range of an enemy
operative. If you do, that friendly operative isn’t incapacitated, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be incapacitated for the remainder
of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free Dash action, but must end that move within
this operative’s control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operative’s APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively,
and if this rule was used during that friendly operative’s activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is
incapacitated, or if it’s a Shoot action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.
