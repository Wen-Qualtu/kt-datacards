STRATEGY PLOY
CLEARANCE SWEEP
The Kasrkin advance steadily towards their objectives,
clearing the battlefield of enemies quadrant
by quadrant.
Place your Clearance Sweep marker in the
killzone. Whenever a friendly KASRKIN®
operative within 5" horizontally of that marker is
shooting an operative also within 5" horizontally
of that marker, that friendly operative’s weapons
have the Ceaseless weapon rule. In the Ready
step of the next Strategy phase, remove
that marker.

SAMPLE 5: battleclade/strategy-ploys/duty-of-reclamation_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGY PLOY
DUTY OF RECLAMATION |
Embedded in Battleclade operatives are lurking strands
of enhanced binharic doctrine. These instructions await
the moment to activate, triggered by the proximity of a
Tech-Priest’s designated prize.
Once per action, you can use the Command Re-
roll firefight ploy for OCP if the attack or defence
dice was rolled for a friendly BATTLECLADE®
operative that contests an objective marker or
one of your mission markers.

SAMPLE 6: battleclade/strategy-ploys/incantation-of-the-iron-soul_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGY PLOY
INCANTATION OF THE IRON SOUL |
Through chanted binharic praise from the Tech-Priests,
or sparked by holy subroutines, microactuators lock
into bracing positions and reserve power cells are
brought online. The flesh may be weak, but the sacred
invulnerability of the Machine God’s augmetic blessings
is evident to all.
Whenever an attack dice inflicts damage of 3 or
more on a friendly BATTLECLADE® operative,
roll one D6: on a 5+, subtract 1 from that
inflicted damage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGY PLOY
BITTER DEMISE
Consumed by hatred, the Blooded spit, curse and lash
out as they die, screaming aggrieved words of heresy as
they land a final-strike upon the foe.
Whenever a friendly BLOODED® operative is
incapacitated, before it’s removed from the
killzone, roll one D3: on a 3 (or 2+ if that friendly
operative has one of your Blooded tokens),
inflict damage equal to the result on one
enemy operative visible to and within 2" of that
friendly operative.

SAMPLE 8: blooded/strategy-ploys/glory-kill_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGY PLOY
GLORY KILL
By bringing down the strongest and most capable of
enemies, the Blooded may provide a worthy offering to
the Ruinous Powers.
Select one enemy operative visible to a friendly
BLOODED® operative. Until the end of the turning
point, whenever a friendly BLOODED® operative
is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating
against that enemy operative, that shooting,
fighting or retaliating operative’s weapons have
the Ceaseless weapon rule, or Relentless if it has
one of your Blooded tokens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRATEGY PLOY
AMPED UP |
Orks thrive in the chaos and cacophony of battle. The
greater the explosions and destruction around them, the
more their adrenaline kicks in. When whipped up into
such a fury, they can fight on through injuries that would
ordinarily lay them low.
Each friendly WRECKA KREW@ operative that has
an Engage order can immediately regain up to
D3+1 lost wounds (roll separately for each).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESTRUCTION

If an enemy takes cover, this just provides Wrecka
Krews with the opportunity to blow more stuff up.
Friendly WRECKA KREW@ operatives’ ranged
weapons have the Saturate weapon rule.
