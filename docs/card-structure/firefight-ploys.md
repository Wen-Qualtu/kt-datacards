SAMPLE 1: kasrkin/firefight-ploys/cover-retreat_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
COVER RETREAT |
Should a Kasrkin soldier need to retreat, their allies may
lay down a withering barrage of covering fire.
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly KASRKIN®
operative performs the Fall Back action while
visible to and within 6" of another friendly
KASRKIN@ operative that’s not within control
range of enemy operatives. After that friendly
operative has finished moving, but before
that Fall Back action ends, that other friendly
operative can immediately perform a free Shoot
action (you can change its order to Engage to
do so).

SAMPLE 2: kasrkin/firefight-ploys/give-no-ground_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
GIVE NO GROUND |
Hardened by a lifetime spent defending the Imperium
from the horrific denizens of the Eye of Terror, the
Kasrkin demonstrate unwavering discipline in the face
of the enemy.
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly KASRKIN®
operative’s activation, or at the end of the
Firefight phase. Select one of your mission
markers or an objective marker. Until the end of
that activation or until the start of the next turning
point respectively, if the total APL of friendly
KASRKIN® operatives that contest that marker
is 2, and the total APL of enemy operatives
that contest it is the same, friendly KASRKIN®@
operatives control that marker.

SAMPLE 3: deathwatch/firefight-ploys/advanced-auspex-scan_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
ADVANCED AUSPEX SCAN |
Between unstinting sweeps of their bioscryer cuffs,
their inbuilt auspexes warning of hostile threats and the
augmented instincts of the Deathwatch themselves, no
lurking threat can long evade their sights.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly
DEATHWATCH operative performs the
Shoot action. Until the end of the activation/
counteraction, its ranged weapons have the
Saturate weapon rule and enemy operatives
cannot be obscured.

SAMPLE 4: deathwatch/firefight-ploys/auspicator-tracking_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
AUSPICATOR TRACKING |
Neurally connected to a battle-brother’s senses,
auspicator lenses can improve their data prescience to
almost precognitive levels.

Use this firefight ploy when a friendly
DEATHWATCH® operative is counteracting,
before it performs any actions. You can change
its order.

SAMPLE 5: battleclade/firefight-ploys/auto-ferric-supplication_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
AUTO-FERRIC SUPPLICATION |
In extremis, the Omnissiah’s faithful channel their zeal
into shielding energy projectors and the refractive
realignment of their bionic body parts.

Use this firefight ploy when an operative is
shooting a friendly BATTLECLADE® TECH-PRIEST
operative, at the start of the Roll Attack Dice step.
Until the end of the sequence, ignore the Piercing
weapon rule.

SAMPLE 6: battleclade/firefight-ploys/remote-access_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
REMOTE ACCESS |

Projecting a canticle of hexamathic authority, the most

worthy Tech-Priests can commune with intransigent

machine spirits even without physical contact.

Use this firefight ploy during a friendly

BATTLECLADE® TECH-PRIEST operative’s

activation. Once during that activation, you can

use one of the following rules:

e That operative doesn’t require a marker to be
within its control range to perform a mission
action that usually requires this (this takes
precedence over that action’s conditions).
Instead, the marker must be within 4" of it
and no enemy operatives can contest that
marker. However, you can ignore enemy
operatives within control range of other
friendly BATTLECLADE® operatives when
determining this.

e That operative doesn’t require a hatchway’s
access point to be within its control range to
perform an Operate Hatch action. Instead, that
access point must be within 4" of it.

SAMPLE 7: blooded/firefight-ploys/callous-disregard_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
CALLOUS DISREGARD |
Pity is a trait of the weak. The Blooded will gladly turn
their guns upon their own kin if doing so will ensure the
destruction of an enemy.
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly BLOODED®
operative performs the Shoot action and you’re
selecting a valid target. Having other friendly
BLOODED® operatives within an enemy
operative’s control range doesn’t prevent that
enemy operative from being selected. Until
the end of that action, whenever you discard
an attack dice as a fail, inflict damage equal to
the dice result on one friendly operative of your
choice within control range of the target.

SAMPLE 8: blooded/firefight-ploys/dark-favour_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
DARK FAVOUR |
Those who have spilled the blood of the foe and earned
the favour of their infernal patron may be spared from
death, as long as another pays the price in their stead.
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly BLOODED®
operative that has one of your Blooded tokens
is selected as the valid target of a Shoot action
or to fight against during the Fight action. Select
one other friendly BLOODED® operative visible
to and within 3" of that first friendly operative to
become the valid target or to be fought against
(as appropriate) instead (even if it wouldn’t
normally be valid for this). If it’s the Fight action,
treat that other operative as being within the
fighting operative’s control range for the duration
of that action. If it’s the Shoot action, that other
operative is only in cover or obscured if the
original target was.
This ploy has no effect if it’s the Shoot action
and the ranged weapon has the Blast or Torrent
weapon rule.

SAMPLE 9: wrecka-krew/firefight-ploys/demolition-job_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
DEMOLITION JOB
Should a prime target present itself, the Wrecka
Krew will unleash their combined destructive might,
demolishing anything in the vicinity.

Use this firefight ploy after a friendly WRECKA
KREW® operative performs the Shoot or Fight
action, just before incapacitated operatives are
removed (if any). Place one of your Demolition
markers within the target’s control range (if

it’s using a Blast weapon, the primary target).
Whenever a friendly WRECKA KREW® operative
(excluding BOMB SQUIG) is shooting against,
fighting against or retaliating against an operative
that’s within 3" of that marker, you can spend

a Wrecka point for free (even if you have none).
In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase,
remove that marker.

SAMPLE 10: wrecka-krew/firefight-ploys/just-a-scratch_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREFIGHT PLOY
JUST A SCRATCH |
Orks have a remarkable ability to shrug off grievous
damage that would incapacitate most other creatures.
Use this firefight ploy when an attack dice inflicts
Normal Dmg on a friendly WRECKA KREW®
operative (excluding BOMB SQUIG). Ignore that
inflicted damage.
