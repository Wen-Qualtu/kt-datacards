SAMPLE 2: kasrkin/equipment/foregrip_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
FOREGRIP
Fitted under the barrel of the gun, this foregrip helps
stabilise the bearer’s weapon, improving its handling at
close range.
Whenever a friendly KASRKIN® operative is
shooting an operative within 3" of it, ranged
weapons on its datacard (excluding weapons
that include ‘pistol’ in their name, e.g. hot-shot
laspistol, all profiles of a plasma pistol, etc.) have
the Accurate 1 weapon rule.

SAMPLE 3: deathwatch/equipment/ammunition-reserve_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
AMMUNITION RESERVE
Awarded to kill teams whose marksmanship is as
efficient as it is lethal, additional caches of individually
crafted shells, fuel canisters and ammunition cells serve
to secure victory during the most dangerous missions.
Once per battle, you can use the Special Issue
Ammunition faction rule for up to two Shoot
actions during one turning point, but you must
select different weapon rules for both uses. This
takes precedence over the normal Special Issue
Ammunition rules.

SAMPLE 4: deathwatch/equipment/digital-weapons_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
DIGITAL WEAPONS
Various high-powered lasers, toxic needlers, incineration
projectors and more are concealed as bionic implants or
in the knuckles of gauntlets. They lack the power to be
used at range, but can be triggered up close to exploit a
weakness while the enemy fends off the main attack.
Once per turning point, when a friendly
DEATHWATCH® operative performs the Fight
action, at the start of the Roll Attack Dice step,
you can use this rule. If you do, inflict 1 damage
on the enemy operative in that sequence.

SAMPLE 5: battleclade/equipment/concealed-apparatus_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT

CONCEALED APPARATUS
Seemingly lightly equipped servitors can, at an
imperative from their master, swiftly assemble far more
deadly apparatus, the components of which were hidden
in body cavities or as entirely different mechanisms.
STRATEGIC GAMBIT in the second turning point.
You can swap the locations of any number of
friendly BATTLECLADE® SERVITOR operatives
with each other (excluding GUN SERVITOR),
and you can swap the locations of friendly
BATTLECLADE® GUN SERVITOR operatives with
each other (remove them from the killzone and
set them back up again). You cannot swap any
operatives that have done any of the following
during the battle:
e Used any weapons on their datacard.
e Performed any actions on their datacard.
e Used the Mechanosuture Array rule

(see TECHNOMEDIC).

SAMPLE 6: battleclade/equipment/covert-guises_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
COVERT GUISES
Using filthy bodysuits of local design, falsified insignia or
emitters that broadcast shrouding static-filled hisses to
foil biological senses, this Battleclade can infiltrate into
restricted areas undetected.
After revealing this equipment option, roll one
D3. As a STRATEGIC GAMBIT in the first turning
point, a number of friendly BATTLECLADE®
operatives equal-to the result that are wholly
within your drop zone can immediately perform
a free Reposition action, but must end that
move wholly within 3" of your drop zone. Your
TECHNOARCHEOLOGIST operative cannot
perform more than one Reposition action in the
Strategy phase of the first turning point (i.e. as a
result of the Seeker of Divine Arcana rule as well).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAOS SIGIL

The disquieting sigils carried by the Blooded bend
reality and thin the veil between realspace and the
ever-shifting tides of the warp.

The Reward Earned firefight ploy costs you OCP.

SAMPLE 8: blooded/equipment/sinister-trophies_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
SINISTER TROPHIES
The Blooded adorn their armour with severed heads
affixed to rusty spikes, cloaks and tabards of flayed skin,
and all manner of other grisly trophies hacked from the
corpses of their victims.
Whenever an enemy operative is shooting
against, fighting against or retaliating against
a friendly BLOODED® operative that has one of
your Blooded tokens and is within 2" of it, your
opponent cannot re-roll their attack dice results
of 1.

SAMPLE 9: wrecka-krew/equipment/drill-rokkits_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
DRILL ROKKITS
Mek ingenuity knows few bounds. Drill rokkits are
designed to strike a target and bore through thick
armour before exploding.
Once per turning point, when a friendly WRECKA
KREW® operative is performing the Shoot action
and you select a rokkit launcha or ’eavy rokkit
launcha, you can use this rule. If you do, until the
end of that action, that weapon loses the Blast
weapon rule but has the Piercing 1 weapon rule.

SAMPLE 10: wrecka-krew/equipment/engine-oil_front.jpg
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FACTION EQUIPMENT
ENGINE OIL
Wrecka Krews are known to ingest the oils of vehicles
they have destroyed. The intoxicating fluid bolsters their
natural resilience.
Once per turning point, when a friendly WRECKA
KREW® operative (excluding BOMB SQUIG) is
activated, you can use this rule. If you do, until
the end of that activation, you can ignore any
changes to that operative’s stats from being
injured (including its weapons’ stats).
