FACTION RULE
NOOSPHERIC NETWORK
Servitors are yoked to their Tech-Priest masters by
an invisible web of control. This noospheric network
enables servitors to be rapidly reorganised, transferring
processing power to other thralls who might better serve
the Tech-Priests’ immediate wishes. While some are
left to conform to their basic programming, others are
instructed with key tasks that must be fulfilled for the
glory of the Machine God.
Whenever a friendly BATTLECLADE® SERVITOR
operative is activated, you can TRANSFER
POWER. If you do, subtract 1 from its APL stat
until the end of that activation.
After that activation, you can NETWORK
COUNTERACT with one other friendly
BATTLECLADE® SERVITOR operative before your
opponent activates. Whenever you NETWORK
COUNTERACT with a friendly operative, first
select its order. It can then perform a 1AP action
for free, but cannot move. Once it’s done so, your
opponent then activates as normal.
