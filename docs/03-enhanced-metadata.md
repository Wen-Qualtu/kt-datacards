# Feature 03: Output Metadata Tracking

## Status
ðŸ”´ Not Started

## Overview
Create an `output-metadata.yaml` file that tracks what cards have been processed and extracted for each team. This provides an inventory/manifest of the output folder, making it easy to see what content is available for each team.

**Note:** This is separate from `config/team-name-mapping.yaml`, which remains a simple name normalization config file.

## Current State
- `config/team-name-mapping.yaml` - Simple name aliases (keep as-is)
- No metadata file tracking processed output
- No easy way to see what cards each team has
- No inventory of operative names, ploy names, faction rules

## Proposed Structure: `output-metadata.yaml`

```yaml
# Generated metadata tracking processed output
# Auto-generated by pipeline after extraction

## Features to Track

### 1. Team Identity
- **canonical_name**: Official display name for the team
- **faction**: Primary faction (Imperium, Chaos, Xenos, etc.)
- **subfaction**: Sub-faction or army (Space Marines, Astra Militarum, etc.)

### 2. Card Inventory
For each card type, track:
- **count**: Number of cards of this type
- **cards**: List of card names (extracted from filename or content)
  - Each card entry includes just the name
  - Names extracted from image filenames (e.g., `assault-intercessor-grenadier_front.jpg`)

### 3. Processing Information
- **last_processed**: ISO timestamp of when this team was last processed
- **source_pdfs**: List of source PDF filenames in processed/ folder
- **total_cards**: Sum of all cards across all types
- **complete**: Boolean indicating if all expected card types are present

### 4. Card Types Tracked
- `datacards` - Individual operative datacards
- `equipment` - Equipment cards
- `faction-rules` - Faction rule cards
- `firefight-ploys` - Firefight ploy cards
- `operatives` - Operative overview card(s)
- `strategy-ploys` - Strategy ploy cards

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Metadata Generator
- [ ] Create `OutputMetadataGenerator` class
- [ ] Scan `output/` directory structure
- [ ] Extract card names from filenames
- [ ] Count cards per type per team
- [ ] Generate YAML structure

### Phase 2: Card Name Extraction
- [ ] Parse image filenames to get card names
- [ ] Handle `_front.jpg` and `_back.jpg` suffixes
- [ ] Convert kebab-case to Title Case (e.g., `assault-intercessor-grenadier` â†’ `Assault Intercessor Grenadier`)
- [ ] Deduplicate (count front/back as one card)

### Phase 3: Faction/Subfaction Detection
- [ ] Create faction mapping (manual or auto-detect)
- [ ] Infer faction from team name patterns where possible
- [ ] Allow manual override in config

### Phase 4: Auto-Generation on Pipeline Run
- [ ] Integrate metadata generation into pipeline
- [ ] Generate/update `output-metadata.yaml` after extraction step
- [ ] Update timestamps automatically
- [ ] Preserve manual edits (faction/subfaction)

### Phase 5: Metadata Reader Utility
- [ ] Create helper class to read metadata
- [ ] Query methods: `get_team()`, `get_all_teams()`, `get_cards_by_type()`
- [ ] Filter methods: `teams_by_faction()`, `incomplete_teams()`

### Phase 6: Reporting & Validation
- [ ] Create status report script
- [ ] Show team completeness (missing card types)
- [ ] List all available content
- [ ] Validate output/ matches metadata

## Usage Examples

### Generating Metadata
```python
from src.generators.metadata_generator import OutputMetadataGenerator

generator = OutputMetadataGenerator(output_dir='output')
metadata = generator.generate()
generator.save('output-metadata.yaml')
```

### Reading Metadata
```python
from src.utils.metadata_reader import OutputMetadata

metadata = OutputMetadata.load('output-metadata.yaml')

# Get team info
team = metadata.get_team('kasrkin')
print(team['canonical_name'])  # "Kasrkin"
print(team['faction'])  # "Imperium"
print(team['total_cards'])  # 30

# Get card list
datacards = team['datacards']['cards']
for card in datacards:
    print(card['name'])  # "Kasrkin Trooper", etc.

# Query across teams
imperium_teams = metadata.teams_by_faction('Imperium')
incomplete = metadata.incomplete_teams()
```

### Status Report
```bash
python script/generate_status_report.py

# Output:
=== Team Inventory Report ===

## Benefits

### 1. Quick Overview
- See all available content at a glance
- Know what cards each team has
- Identify missing or incomplete teams

### 2. Content Discovery
- Find specific cards across teams
- List all operatives, ploys, equipment by team
- Search for specific card names

### 3. Validation
- Verify output/ folder contents match expectations
- Detect missing or extra files
- Ensure all card types are present

### 4. Documentation
- Auto-generated inventory of all processed content
- Easy reference for TTS deck building
- Historical record of what's been processed

## Notes

- File is auto-generated - manual edits to faction/subfaction should be preserved
- Card names extracted from filenames (may need manual cleanup for special characters)
- Metadata generation should be idempotent (running twice produces same result)
- File should be committed to git to track content changes over time
- Consider adding to .gitignore if too much churn, but recommended to track it

## Related Features

- **Feature 04**: Stats extraction could add card stats to this metadata
- **Feature 05**: Parameterized execution could use this to filter by faction/subfaction
