Whenever a friendly BROOD BROTHER  operative (excluding PATRIARCH) is incapacitated while fighting or retaliating, if you have any unresolved successes, you can roll one D6: if the result is a success as if it were the Roll Attack Dice step of that sequence (i.e. using the same weapon, but with no re-rolls), you can strike the enemy operative in that sequence with one of your unresolved normal successes, or any of your successes instead if the D6 result is a critical success. In either case, that friendly operative is removed from the killzone afterwards."
