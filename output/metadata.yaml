            operative, you can interrupt that activation and activate a ready friendly

            cannot do so against any other enemy operatives until it does (if this
            isn’t possible, that friendly operative’s activation is cancelled). After
            completing that friendly operative’s activation, continue that enemy operative’s
            activation (if possible). You cannot use this ploy again until that enemy

        description: WRECKA KREW FACTION RULE TANKED UP Wrecka Krews are empowered
          by the thrill of explosive combat, lending them fresh impetus as they undertake
          their murderous rampages. The first time a friendly WRECKA KREW operative

          description: Should a prime target present itself, the Wrecka Krew will
            unleash their combined destructive might, demolishing anything in the
            vicinity. Use this firefight ploy after a friendly WRECKA KREW  operative
            performs the Shoot or Fight action, just before incapacitated operatives
            are removed (if any). Place one of your Demolition markers within the
            target’s control range (if it’s using a Blast weapon, the primary target).
            Whenever a friendly WRECKA KREW  operative (excluding BOMB SQUIG) is shooting
            against, fighting against or retaliating against an operative that’s within
            3" of that marker, you can spend a Wrecka point for free (even if you
            have none). In the Ready step of the next Strategy phase, remove that
            marker.
        - name: Just A Scratch
          description: Orks have a remarkable ability to shrug off grievous damage
            that would incapacitate most other creatures. Use this firefight ploy
            when an attack dice inflicts Normal Dmg on a friendly WRECKA KREW operative
            (excluding BOMB SQUIG). Ignore that inflicted damage.
        - name: Kaboom
          description: The more intense the dakka and the louder the boom of explosions,
            the more satisfying the carnage! Use this firefight ploy when a friendly
            WRECKA KREW  operative performs the Shoot action and a weapon with the
            Blast weapon rule is selected. Until the end of that action, add 1" to
            that weapon’s Blast and it has the Severe weapon rule when shooting the
            primary target. You cannot use this ploy and the Drill Rokkits rule (see
            faction equipment) during the same action. Note that Severe doesn’t generate
            a Wrecka point (as it’s not a 6).

          description: Orks like nothing better than a good scrap. With fist or hammer,
            they seek to demonstrate that might is right. Use this firefight ploy
            during a friendly WRECKA KREW  BREAKA BOY or WRECKA KREW  BOSS NOB operative’s
            activation. During that activation, that operative can perform two Fight
            actions.

          description: Orks thrive in the chaos and cacophony of battle. The greater
            the explosions and destruction around them, the more their adrenaline
            kicks in. When whipped up into such a fury, they can fight on through
            injuries that would ordinarily lay them low. Each friendly WRECKA KREW  operative
            that has an Engage order can immediately regain up to D3+1 lost wounds
            (roll separately for each).

          description: If an enemy takes cover, this just provides Wrecka Krews with
            the opportunity to blow more stuff up. Friendly WRECKA KREW  operatives’
            ranged weapons have the Saturate weapon rule.

            take a hit if it means they get to land a few of their own. Whenever an
            operative is shooting a friendly WRECKA KREW  operative that has an Engage
            order, you can re-roll one of your defence dice.

          description: When the Wrecka Krew’s violent rampage reaches its crescendo,
            a rage overcomes them. They bellow the infamous Ork battle cry as they
            set upon their enemies with hammer and fist. Friendly WRECKA KREW  operatives’
            melee weapons have the Balanced weapon rule.
